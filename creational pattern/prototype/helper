when we need to crewate a clone of object

where object is very expensive to create again and again
so
one way is 

Student obj = new Student(...parm);
Student obj2 = new Student();

obj2.name = obj.name;
obj2.name = obj.name;
obj2.name = obj.name;


ans soo one
1. but how to copy the private variable those cant be accessed outside
2. the client where the obj is crveated of student has to know about all the objects and then obly he can copy
example 100 obj we only need to copy 50 of them, but the client will have access to all the 100 


so in order to obercome this  we have prototype whrer within the class we expose the clone function for ease of cloning
